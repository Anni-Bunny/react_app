                <p className="text-base/loose">In February 2022, Jared Isaacman and SpaceX announced the Polaris
                    Program, an effort designed to rapidly advance human spaceflight capabilities, while also supporting
                    important causes here on Earth.

                    Polaris Dawn, the first of the program’s three human spaceflight missions, is targeted to launch to
                    orbit no earlier than summer 2024. During the five-day mission, the crew will perform SpaceX’s
                    first-ever Extravehicular Activity (more commonly known as an EVA or spacewalk) from Dragon, which
                    will also be the first-ever commercial astronaut spacewalk. This historic milestone will also be the
                    first time four astronauts will be exposed to the vacuum of space at the same time.

                    Supporting the crew throughout the spacewalk will be SpaceX’s newly-developed EVA suit, an evolution
                    of the Intravehicular Activity (IVA) suit crews currently wear aboard Dragon human spaceflight
                    missions. Developed with mobility in mind, SpaceX teams incorporated new materials, fabrication
                    processes, and novel joint designs to provide greater flexibility to astronauts in pressurized
                    scenarios while retaining comfort for unpressurized scenarios. The 3D-printed helmet incorporates a
                    new visor to reduce glare during the EVA in addition to the new Heads-Up Display (HUD) and camera
                    that provide information on the suit’s pressure, temperature, and relative humidity. The suit also
                    incorporates enhancements for reliability and redundancy during a spacewalk, adding seals and
                    pressure valves to help ensure the suit remains pressurized and the crew remains safe.

                    All of these enhancements to the EVA suit are part of a scalable design, allowing teams to produce
                    and scale to different body types as SpaceX seeks to create greater accessibility to space for all
                    of humanity.

                    While Polaris Dawn will be the first time the SpaceX EVA suit is used in low-Earth orbit, the suit’s
                    ultimate destiny lies much farther from our home planet. Building a base on the Moon and a city on
                    Mars will require the development of a scalable design for the millions of spacesuits required to
                    help make life multiplanetary.</p>
