                <p className="text-base/loose">The goal of SpaceX is to build the technologies necessary to make life multiplanetary. This is the
                    first time in the 4-billion-year history of Earth that it’s possible to realize that goal and
                    protect the light of consciousness.

                    At Starbase on Thursday, April 4, SpaceX Chief Engineer Elon Musk provided an update on the
                    company’s plans to send humanity to Mars, the best destination to begin making life multiplanetary.

                    All of SpaceX’s current programs, including Falcon, Dragon, Starlink, and Starship are integral to
                    developing the technologies necessary to make missions to Mars a reality. The update included
                    near-term priorities for Starship that will unlock its ability to be fully and rapidly reusable, the
                    core enabler for transforming humanity’s ability to send large amounts of payload to orbit and
                    beyond. With more flight tests, significant vehicle upgrades, and missions returning astronauts to
                    the surface of the Moon with NASA’s Artemis Program all coming soon, excitement will continue to be
                    guaranteed with Starship.

                    The talk also includes the mechanics and challenges of traveling to Mars, along with what we’re
                    building today to enable sending around a million people and several million tonnes to the Martian
                    surface in the years to come.</p>
